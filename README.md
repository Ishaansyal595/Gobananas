This React application fetches data from an API and displays it in a responsive layout using Material-UI. The app includes a search bar that allows users to filter the displayed items based on their input.

Features:-

Data Fetching:- The app fetches posts from the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts URL when it loads. Fetched data is stored in the component's state (data and filteredData).
Search Functionality:- A search bar is provided for users to type their queries. As the search input changes, the app filters the data and displays only the items that match the search query.
Responsive Layout:- The app uses Material-UI's Grid system to create a responsive design that works well on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
